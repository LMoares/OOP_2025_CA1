# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to serve as a prototype application for Responsible Consumption goal from the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 

This project simulates a user based application where users are able to log into existing accounts or create new accounts. Each user's account functions as a Carbon Footprint Score (CFS) tracker and Resonsible Consumption Logging tool. This function allows each user to lower their CFS via the logging tool, allowing the user to track real life instances of lowering their Carbon Footprint; such as: recycling batteries, taking public transport, learning about sustainable and renewable sources of energy. Each user's CFS is tracked via our NoSQL database and allows each user to track their place, and the place of other users, within the leaderboard.

### Each group member is responsible for 3 distinct sections of the applications:
* Aaron Byrne - Sustainable Tourism & Travel
* Lorenzo Moares Nunez - Sustainable Consumption and Production
* Jean Walton - Chemicals and Waste
