Solar Panels allow households to contribute to lowering
their overall Carbon Footprint Score by generating 
renewable electricity. 

Households that utilize Solar Panels are able to not 
only passively generate energy for their own purposes.
But also have the added benefit of supplying excess
surplus power back to the grid. This surplus energy 
affords these households with the benefit of selling
electricity back to the grid; lowering their Carbon 
Footprint Score and making positive contributions 
to the energy conservation of their wider communities.

Recycling Bins allow households to contribute to 
lowering their overall Carbon Footprint by preventing
excess refuse from entering landfills and allow for 
recycled refuse to be reused for the creation of new
products.

Proper recycling prevents refuse from being placed in
large landfills. These recyclable items further add to
the immense size that landfills take up and take
decades to naturally degrade. Furthermore, these items
contain chemicals that are harmful to the environment
and leach these chemicals into the ground slowly over
the years.

Recyclable products that are properly disposed of,
provide a myriad of benefits to sustainable
consumption.

The energy required to recycle these items into new
products if far less than the energy needed to create
these products from scratch. In addition, since these
items are being reused, they can continue to recycled
time and time again, with much less impact on the
environment.

A Compost Garden allow households to contribute to 
lowering their overall Carbon Footprint by utilizing
organic waste for the benefit of the household. 

This organic waste can be used as a cost effective
fertilizer for a wide variety of gardens. This waste
can range from meal scraps, organic cooking waste
such as egg shells, and even used pieces of kitchen
rolls.

These Compost Gardens can be used to grow a wide
variety of produce for the household, offsetting
the overall cost of grocery shopping during spring,
summer, and fall seasons. Composting regularly adds
much required fuel for beneficial micro bacteria
that break the organic waste down into vital
and healthy nutrients that plants require to grow.

Composting in this way reduces the need for buying
alternative fertilizers such as those that use animal
refuse for plant nutrients. Thus reducing the demand
for such items and greatly reducing the overall
Carbon Footprint Score of each household that 
participates in composting.
