Smoke Detectors with Americium-241
- Handling:
- Do not attempt to dismantle or break open the detector — 
  the americium is sealed inside a metal chamber.
- Store intact in a safe place until disposal.
- Keep away from children and pets.
- Where to Dispose:
- Do not put in household recycling or general waste.
- Return to the manufacturer or supplier (many offer take-back programs).
- Bring to Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) centres or civic amenity sites 
  — check first if they accept radioactive items.
- In Ireland, local councils may direct you to specialized disposal routes 
  for radioactive consumer products.
- PPE Required:
- Normally none if the detector is intact — the americium is safely sealed.
- If handling broken or damaged units, wear gloves, goggles, and a mask, 
  and place in a sealed bag/container for transport.
