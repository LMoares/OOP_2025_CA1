Cosmetic & Chemical Waste
1. Bring to your local amenity site
Council recycling centres often accept HHW. 
The Rediscovery Centre also notes that they collect paint from Recycling Centre,
suggesting a hazardous waste scheme is in place.
DO NOT PUT IN HOUSEHOLD BINS!
Hair Dye (unused/partially used):
These are considered Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) 
due to the chemicals (e.g., ammonia, peroxides).
PPE:
Disposable Gloves (nitrile) and Ventilation.
Safety:
Keep the original containers sealed. If a bottle breaks, 
open windows and wipe up immediately with paper towels before sealing all 
debris in an airtight container for HHW disposal.
Nail Polish:
Due to their flammable components (solvents like ethyl acetate) 
and chemical content, nail polish bottles are HHW.
PPE:
Disposable Gloves and Ventilation.
Safety:
Always ensure the lid is screwed on tightly. If spilled, 
wipe immediately with paper towels as the solvents evaporate quickly, 
then seal the rags/paper towels in a bag and dispose of as HHW.
Empty Aerosol Cans (Non-toxic contents like deodorant, hairspray):
Recycling centre only. 
Ensure the can is fully empty and do not puncture or crush it. 
Take it to the recycling centre's designated area.
PPE:
Disposable Gloves (optional for handling)
Safety:
Do NOT remove the nozzle. 
Ensure the can is fully depressurized (shaking it should make no sound). 
Transport them carefully to avoid piercing.
