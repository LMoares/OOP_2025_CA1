E-waste (WEEE):
DO NOT BUT IN HOUSEHOLD BINS!
1. Bring to your local amenity site
2. Electrical Retailers (WEEE regulations mandate that shops 
selling these items must take back old equivalent items for free, 
even without a new purchase).
Toxicity:
Moderate. The main risk is from internal batteries (fire hazard if damaged) 
and small amounts of heavy metals (like Lead and Cadmium) 
if the casing is broken.
The risk comes from the residual ink (a stain/mess) or toner powder, 
which can contain some chemicals/heavy metals not suitable for landfill.
PPE:
Disposable Gloves (nitrile) if there is any residue. 
Safety Goggles if the screen/case is cracked, to protect against glass shards.
