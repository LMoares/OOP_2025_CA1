Rubber & Plastic Recycling:
Used Tires:
DO NOT PUT IN HOUSEHOLD BINS!
1. Tyre Retailers/Garages: When you buy new tires, the retailer is legally 
required to take the old ones back for recycling 
(usually for a small fee, which is included in the new tire price as an 
Environmental Management Cost). 
2. Recycling Centre: The centre may accept a limited number of tyres, 
often for a fee. Always call ahead to confirm their specific policy.
PPE:
Heavy-duty gloves (to protect hands from cuts/dirt) 
and appropriate footwear (due to weight) when lifting.
Plastic Tubs/Bottles 
(Yogurt pots, butter tubs, shampoo bottles, drinks bottles, etc.):
MUST BE CLEAN, DRY, and LOOSE. Rinse out food residue.
Your Household Green Recycling Bin. 
Also, plastic drinks bottles with the Re-Turn logo can be taken to a 
reverse vending machine for a deposit refund.
PPE:
No special PPE required—just make sure they are clean 
before placing them in your bin.
Plastic Tools/Scrap:
DO NOT PUT IN HOUSEHOLD BINS!
Separate these from packaging plastics.
Recycle centers:
These items usually go into a designated skip for bulky, mixed plastics, 
and there may be a small charge 
(€5 for a large item like a plastic toy or bag of bulky plastic scrap).
PPE:
Disposable or heavy-duty gloves (
to protect against sharp edges, dirt, or residue) 
when handling broken items.
